Updated Examples
================

This experimental doc restructures the existing :ref:`examples` section by:

* Grouping examples by common topic
* Consolidating & updating examples into a more uniform active format
* Updating references to leverage the latest SDK constructs (notably GlobusApp)

While in ``experimental`` it should be considered a work in progress and subject to
change. Once complete, it'll be merged into the main documentation, replacing the
existing examples section.
