Scopes and Consents
===================

Globus uses OAuth2 scopes to control access to different APIs and allow
applications provide a least-privilege security guarantee to their users.

Within the Globus SDK, Scopes and Consents are modeled using several objects
which make learning about and manipulating these data easier.

For more information, see
`this docs.globus.org explanation of scopes and consents
