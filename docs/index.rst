Globus SDK for Python (Beta)
============================

This SDK provides a convenient Pythonic interface to
`Globus <https://www.globus.org>`_ REST APIs,
including the Transfer API and the Globus Auth API. Documentation
for the REST APIs is available at https://docs.globus.org.

Two interfaces are provided - a low level interface, supporting only
``GET``, ``PUT``, ``POST``, and ``DELETE`` operations, and a high level
interface providing helper methods for common API resources.

Source code is available at https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-python.

Installation
============

The Globus SDK requires `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ 2.6+ or 3.2+.
If a supported version of Python is not already installed on your system, see
this `Python installation guide \
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`_.

The simplest way to install the Globus SDK is using the ``pip`` package manager
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip), which is included in most Python
installations:

::

    pip install globus-sdk

This will install the Globus SDK and it's dependencies.

Bleeding edge versions of the Globus SDK can be installed by checking out the
git repository and installing it manually:

::

    git clone https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-python.git
    cd globus-sdk-python
    python setup.py install


Basic Usage
===========

Most APIs require authentication using an access token, so the first
step to using the SDK is to acquire a token. For development, the
simplest way to get a token is to use the `Globus Tokens
<https://tokens.globus.org>`_ webapp. Globus Tokens provides you with
tokens for all Globus APIs which are valid for two days, and are tied to
a consent for ``Globus Tokens``. The appropriate method for obtaining
tokens for a production application depends on the type of application,
and is outside the scope of the SDK documentation (see the REST
documentation at https://docs.globus.org).

The webapp will provide you with instructions to save your tokens to the Globus
SDK config file, at ``~/.globus.cfg``.

To use the Transfer API:

.. code-block:: python

    from __future__ import print_function # for python 2
    from globus_sdk import TransferClient

    tc = TransferClient() # uses transfer_token from the config file

    # high level interface; provides iterators for list responses
    print("My Endpoints:")
    for ep in tc.endpoint_search(filter_scope="my-endpoints"):
        print(ep["display_name"], ep["id"])
