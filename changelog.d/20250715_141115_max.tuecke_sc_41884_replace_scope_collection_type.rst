Changed
-------

- Replaced the ``globus_sdk._types.ScopeCollectionType`` alias with explicit ``str | Scope | t.Iterable[str | Scope]`` type annotations. (:pr:`1259`)
    - Removed support for nested scope collections in the scope normalization functions (e.g., nested iterables like ``[["scope1"], "scope2"]``).
