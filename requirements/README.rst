Requirements Data
-----------------

These ``*.txt`` data are autogenerated from ``[dependency-groups]`` data.
There are gitignored, hidden ``.in`` files in this directory as a part of that process.

Modify the sources manually, then regenerate the "pinned" or "locked" dependencies with ``tox r -m freezedeps``.
